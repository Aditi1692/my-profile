This is a demonstration of a *repository-based* Cloudlab profile. Repository based profiles are
a great way to combine a git repository (for source code control) and a Cloudlab profile
(for experiment control). The Cloudlab profile that is based on this repository can be found at 
https://www.cloudlab.us/p/PortalProfiles/RepoBased.

If you have software to install/run, you could put that into this repository,
it will be cloned to each of the nodes in your experiment, to /local/repository.
